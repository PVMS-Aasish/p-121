# Project 121 - Background Matters

Story: - Sohail and his family had plans to visit Bangkok this summer vacation. Unfortunately, they
had to cancel the trip due to COVID situation in his country.
However, Sohail decided to play a prank on his friends. Using his programming skills, he
decided to create pictures of herself containing the background of the famous places in
Bangkok City - The Grand Palace, Temple of Emerald Buddha etc. He would then send these
pictures to his friends as if he is already on the planned trip.

Project: - When Sohail stands in front of a black background, his background gets replaced by a random image place from Bangkok and he can share them with his friends.
